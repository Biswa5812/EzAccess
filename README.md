# EzAccess 👨‍💻
>This project aims in solving out a local problem faced by students at my college, as online classes are taking over our curriculum and the process to launch a class stands quite redundant. Logging into the student account then searching for the correct class link, this process becomes quite cumbersome to be done for each class.
So, why don't we sit back and let python take over the task of repeating the process!!!

Hence introducing **EzAccess** a simple automated project to take care of your online classes.

## Built With 🛠

> - **Selenium:** It a framework for automating and testing web applications, Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.
